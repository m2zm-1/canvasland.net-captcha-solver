I Will Answer A Typical Question: 

How Do I Use It?

Now your Tampermonkey is installed on your phone (installed with Firefox or Kiwi Browser) or on your computer. First of all, enter Tampermonkey's Script Control Panel

Then open a new script and select all the codes in this .js file with Ctrl+A. Then copy and paste it to the new Tampermonkey script. Don't forget to save!

And BOOM! Captcha Solver Work.
